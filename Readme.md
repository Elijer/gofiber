# Reasons for working on this project
I started this project because I wanted a refresher in React and React Three Fiber allows the use of React to handle ThreeJS state. I've already written a Node backend, so I thought I would write the backend in Go since that seemed like a good way to learn Go and more realistic for a quick project than learning rust for this purpose. Go also seems really well suited to the task honestly.

In summary, this is a way to
1) Practice React and learn React Three Fiber
2) Try rewriting the project slowly and carefully and see if there are opportunities to improve the design
3) Learn Go
